        <p>&ldquo;I will buy you the toy car on your birthday, Varun,&rdquo; yelled Mumma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Varun tried to reason with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has Mumma told you to do when she is working?&rdquo; Mumma bristled with rage while continuously typing a mail to her colleague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do - not - disturb,&rdquo; Varun replied to the floor and walked away while folding his hands as if he&rsquo;s trying to contain his anger.</p>
<p>During the dinner, there was an awkward silence. Mumma tried to break the ice, but Varun was adamant and kept quite. She realised that he&rsquo;s taken it very hard as he denied eating his favourite dessert &ndash; a scoop of blackberry current. He plunged out of his chair and ran in his room, banging the door shut behind him.</p>
<p>After the dishes were done, Mumma went to tuck in Varun, and instead, she found him asleep or at least pretending. She smirked while sitting next to him and tried to tickle him, which would usually result in a peal of a soothing laugh. Only this time, he giggled and buried the laughter inwards. She sighed, tucked him in, and kissed him good night on his rosy cheeks. He tried to protest by rubbing his cheeks vigorously and imply, &ldquo;Do - not - kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mumma knew the trick; they always do. The next morning, she packed a peanut butter sandwich and a &lsquo;few&rsquo; french fries for lunch. It is all that usually takes to melt the mighty Varun&rsquo;s anger. She also left a note that said, &ldquo;Sorry Bear! Eat well!&rdquo; in the tiffin, hoping that this would help her case. After the &lsquo;still&rsquo; angry Varun left for school, Mumma went to his room to tidy it up. She picked up all the toys on the floor and made his bed. Underneath the pillow she felt something, it was a notebook. It was Varun&rsquo;s notebook - his personal diary titled, &lsquo;Varun Dairy.&rsquo; Mumma wondered of her obliviousness to this. She looked at every page, stuck in awe at each of them. The latest entry shook her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear God,
Please send Papa back. Mumma says Papa gone to meet you. Papa is good. Never said no to me. Rudh and Naina have race cars. They play after school. I also want it. Mumma says do - not - distrub. Do something.
Love you.
-Varun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With teary eyes, Mumma thought of something. She grabbed a pencil lying on the nightstand and replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Varun,
Mumma and Papa both love you. I love you even more. Ask Mumma for a piggy bank. I will put in the money to buy the remote car. But don&rsquo;t share this letter, it&rsquo;s our secret.
Love you.
-God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She placed the notebook in the same place. With teary eyes, she smirked to herself while folding the blanket.</p>
<p>Later that evening, when Varun returned from her Grandma&rsquo;s, he seemed to have forgotten the earlier conflict. He was merry as always and hugged Mumma before narrating the day&rsquo;s shenanigans. At night, before going to bed, he opened his diary to update it. He looked at the latest entry, and his eyes widened instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God replied!&rdquo; he thought to himself.</p>
<p>Varun read the reply and could not contain the joy. He jumped around his bed, cheering, &ldquo;God has replied. He read my letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran out of his room, went to Mumma&rsquo;s, and barged inside merrily. He hugged her tight and downgraded his demand from the toy racing car to a piggy bank only. Mumma agreed for the bargain, like any other parent would. He returned to his room as the happiest person on this planet, and Mumma went to sleep satisfied.</p>
<p>Every day, for the next month, Varun received a varying amount in his piggy bank. The sum had crossed the cost of a racing car long ago. He was oblivious, Mumma was relaxed to see him joyous in a long time.</p>
<p>On a bright blessed Sunday, Mumma was leaning back on the chair, reading the newspaper with a cup of hot chocolate. Varun was missing since the morning, and it was clear that today was the day. Mumma had already completed the chores to make her available for the happy hours. After a while, Varun barged in the house with a big box. It had Chinese writings all over it and contained pictures of a red F1 car. He dropped the box in her lap and sat in front of her on the floor. Mumma smiled at him and opened the packing gently. There was no car inside, but a pair of a wireless headset, similar to the one she lost a week earlier. Along with it, was a beautiful Mothers day gift card. Surprised and awed at this lovely surprise, Mumma opened the card.</p>
<p>It read, &ldquo;Dear God,</p>
<p>I saw you put money in pigy bank. Thank you for the gift. Happy Mother Day. This is a return gift.</p>
<p>Love you very much.</p>
<p>-Varun.&rdquo;</p>
